\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document delineates the comprehensive procedures associated with the `full-analysis` command within the IEDB Binding Predictor library. It elucidates the methodologies, configurations, and critical considerations requisite for conducting extensive peptide-MHC binding analyses. Emphasis is placed on documentation practices and pertinent scholarly citations to ensure methodological rigor and reproducibility.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The `full-analysis` command serves as a cornerstone feature of the IEDB Binding Predictor, allowing users to perform in-depth analyses of peptide binding affinities to specified MHC Class I alleles. This document provides a detailed exposition of the procedural steps, underlying algorithms, and configurable options that enable researchers to extract meaningful insights from peptide-MHC interaction datasets.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Input Parameters}
The `full-analysis` command accepts several input parameters, essential for tailoring the analysis to specific research needs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pattern}: A regex-like expression used to generate peptide variants (e.g., \texttt{"A[CD]E[FY]GH"}).
    \item \textbf{Alleles}: A comma-separated list of MHC Class I alleles (e.g., \texttt{HLA-A*02:01}).
    \item \textbf{Output}: The designated file path for storing analysis results (e.g., \texttt{results.csv}).
    \item \textbf{Peptides}: An optional file containing a list of peptides for direct analysis.
    \item \textbf{Length}: Specifies the peptide length if it cannot be inferred from the input.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peptide Generation}
Utilizing the specified pattern, the command generates all conceivable peptide variants. This process employs combinatorial algorithms to ensure exhaustive exploration of the defined motifs, thereby maximizing the coverage of potential peptide sequences.

\subsection{Binding Prediction}
For each peptide-allele pair, binding affinity is predicted using the selected methodology (defaulting to NetMHCpan). The procedure involves:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Querying the IEDB API to retrieve binding data.
    \item Parsing the obtained affinities and IC50 values.
    \item Calculating immunogenicity scores based on amino acid properties, as delineated in \cite{smith2020immunogenicity}.
\end{enumerate}

The MHCI binding predictions were made on 4/9/2025 using the IEDB analysis resource NetMHCpan (ver. 4.1) tool \cite{reynisson2020netmhcpan}.

\subsection{Data Filtering and Ranking}
Following prediction, results undergo filtration based on user-defined thresholds for binding scores and IC50 values. Subsequently, rank ordering facilitates the identification of the most promising peptide candidates, thereby streamlining the selection process for further experimental validation.

\subsection{Output Generation}
The analyzed results are exported to a CSV file, formatted according to user specifications (e.g., delimiter and decimal separators). This standardized output format enables seamless integration with downstream bioinformatics tools and analyses.

\section{Configuration Options}
The `set-config` command permits users to customize CSV separators and decimal formats, aligning data formatting with regional settings or personal preferences. This flexibility enhances compatibility and eases data manipulation and interpretation.

\section{Documentation Practices}
Comprehensive inline documentation within the codebase adheres to [PEP 257](https://pep257.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) conventions. Function docstrings provide explicit descriptions of parameters, return values, and example usages, thereby facilitating code maintainability and scalability.

\section{Citations}
Appropriate attribution of utilized methodologies and tools is maintained throughout the documentation and codebase. Key references include:

\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The `full-analysis` command embodies a robust framework for peptide-MHC binding analysis, integrating predictive algorithms with user-centric configurations. Adherence to meticulous documentation standards and proper citation practices underpins the tool's reliability and academic integrity, thereby supporting reproducible scientific research.
