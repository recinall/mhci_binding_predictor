# IEDB Binding Predictor

## Overview

The **IEDB Binding Predictor** is a Python library designed to predict peptide binding affinities to MHC Class I alleles using the IEDB API. It facilitates researchers in immunology and related fields to analyze peptide-MHC interactions, aiding in vaccine design, immunotherapy, and understanding immune responses.

## Features

- **Peptide Binding Prediction:** Utilize various prediction methods, including NetMHCpan, to estimate binding affinities.
- **Immunogenicity Scoring:** Calculate immunogenicity scores based on amino acid properties to assess potential immune responses.
- **Batch Processing:** Analyze large sets of peptides and alleles efficiently with batch processing capabilities.
- **Filtering and Ranking:** Filter results based on binding scores, IC50 values, and immunogenicity thresholds.
- **Variant Generation:** Generate peptide variants from sequence patterns to explore a wide range of potential binders.
- **Configuration Options:** Customize CSV separators and decimal formats to suit different regional settings.
- **Comprehensive CLI:** Command-line interface (CLI) with detailed examples for ease of use.
